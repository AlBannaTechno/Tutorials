* Tagging Lines
- You can set custom tags for the file with the ~#+TAGS~ configuration line
- Tags can be made mutually exclusive by putting them in ~{ }~
- Once set, a line can be tagged by pulling up the tag interface with ~<leader> <leader>~
- Again, you can add tags in the ~.spacemacs~ file as well by
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq org-tag-alist
          '((:startgroup . nil) ("@OFFICE" . ?o) ("@HOME" . ?h) (:endgroup . nil)
            ("COMPUTER" . ?c) ("PHONE" . ?p) ("READING" . ?r)))
  #+END_SRC
